## svelte app

This repo was bootstrapped with a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) template that lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

## Get started

Clone the repo and install the dependencies...

```bash
https://github.com/johngribbin/consensys-space.git
cd consensys-space
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```
